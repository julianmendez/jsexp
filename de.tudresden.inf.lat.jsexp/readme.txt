Description
-----------

  This project is a parser in Java for S-expressions.
  


How to compile this project
---------------------------

In order to compile this project, the following technologies are suggested:

  * Development environment:
    Eclipse 3.4.1
    http://www.eclipse.org

  * Compiler :
    Sun Java Development Kit 6
    http://java.sun.com

  * Build tool :
    Apache Ant 1.7.1
    http://ant.apache.org

Once Java and Apache Ant are installed, it is enough to write "ant" in the main 
directory. Apache Ant reads the "build.xml" file and builds the project.

The jar will be generated in "dist/lib".

The directories have the following structure.

  Source directories: (src)
    * src/doc : text for the javadocs
    * src/main : source code of the main part
    * src/manifest : the manifest.mf file
    * src/test : source code of the unit tests

  Generated directories (dist)      
    * dist/bin : compiled classes
    * dist/javadoc : generated javadocs
    * dist/lib : generated jar file
    * dist/report : generated reports of unit tests
    * dist/test : compiled unit test classes
